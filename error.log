VirtualBox Guest Additions installer
This system appears to have a version of the VirtualBox Guest Additions
already installed.  If it is part of the operating system and kept up-to-date,
there is most likely no need to replace it.  If it is not up-to-date, you
should get a notification when you start the system.  If you wish to replace
it with this version, please do not continue with this installation now, but
instead remove the current version first, following the instructions for the
operating system.

If your system simply has the remains of a version of the Additions you could
not remove you should probably continue now, and these will be removed during
installation.

Do you wish to continue? [yes or no]

An error occurred during installation of VirtualBox Guest Additions 6.1.38. Some functionality may not work as intended.
In most cases it is OK that the "Window System drivers" installation failed.
Job for vboxadd-service.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status vboxadd-service.service" and "journalctl -xeu vboxadd-service.service" for details.
